#SEARCHING ALGORITHMS

'''
1.Linear Search in an unsorted list

* known as Sequential Search as it compares element by element
* time complexity
Case        Best Case  Worst Case  Average Case

item is present       1  n  n/2
item is not present   n  n  n


def linearSearching(arr,item):
    for i in arr:
        if i==item:
            return 1  #Found

    return -1

arr = [ 2, 3, 4, 1, 40 ]
x = 10

print(linearSearching(arr,x))

2. Linear Search in sorted list

*it only improvises the time complexity by (Reducing the comparsions)
and for absent item, still the worst case runtime is o(n)
