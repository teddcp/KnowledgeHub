Solution 2: Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection) 

Detecting Loop:

Have two pointers, classically called hare and tortoise. Move hare by 2 steps and tortoise by 1. If they meet at some point, then there is surely a cycle and the meeting point is obviously inside the cycle.

Finding length of Loop:

Keep one pointer fixed at meeting point while increment the other until they are same again. Increment a counter as you go along and the counter value at meet will be the length of cycle.

Find the start of cycle

Take one pointer to start of the list and keep the other at the meeting point. Now increment both by one and the meet point is the start of loop.
