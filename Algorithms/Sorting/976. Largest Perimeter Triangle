		To find perimeter : sum of 3 edges
		
		Before that,they should perform a valid trianagle.i.e a<=b+c, b<=a+c,c<=a+b
		or 
		say the sidelengths of the triangle are a <= b <= c. 
		The necessary and sufficient condition for these lengths to form a triangle of non-zero area is a + b > c
		
		After sorting, we can eleiminate the last 2 conditions as they are unnencessary.
		So only fst one we need to check and return the sum as perimeter.
